# SaturationPlot

Calculates the complexity of a sequenced library from read counts generated with various tools like HTSeq-count, feature-counts, etc. The input must be a two column input file containing the gene names and the number of reads. The saturation curve displays the number of detectable genes for each million reads. The number of reads must be above the threshold value for a gene to be detectable.
